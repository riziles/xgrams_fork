# New keyboard

After pining for a mechanical Microsoft Natural keyboard for a long long time I finally discovered it! [`Moonlander Keyboard`](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander) and the excellet online laout and ROM flashing editor for it: [`Oryx`](https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/dneZx/latest/0)

# New layout

So then you may as well learn a new key layout. Colemak-DH after some research seemed close enough to perfection. [`dreymar's colemak site`](https://dreymar.colemak.org/training.html)

## New typing tutor

I searched for Mavis Beacon but she has left the building! I slowly discovered a collection of websites to train on:

-   [`Ben Vallack`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI-a64EVPPU) for general The Joy of Typing inspiration.
-   [`Hamaji Neo`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jtGYw22OBw) your keyboard needs an upgrade, or something.
-   [`monkeytype`](https://monkeytype.com/) I get my baseline, graphed over time doing random timed texts, daily.
-   [`ZTYPE`](https://zty.pe/) This is like 12 infinite monkeys typing, but with adrenaline.
-   [`keyzen`](https://github.com/wwwtyro/keyzen) The original keyzen, that spawned numerous others. I hacked several to taste as I regained the ability to code.
-   [`COLEMAK CLUB`](https://gnusenpai.net/colemakclub/) This taught me a few fingers at a time.
-   [`keyzen3`](https://adamgradzki.com/keyzen3/) A keyzen with an interesting UI.
-   [`Ngram Type`](https://ranelpadon.github.io/ngram-type/) More Keyzen, now with ngrams. I hacked this one so much I finally just rewrote it from scratch.
-   [`keybr`](https://www.keybr.com/) I mainlined this from a-z with the hacked Ranel Padon ngrams to focus around the new key.

## Xgram

-   Inspired by the above, most directly descended from the last 4
-   Pangrams to discover weak spots or efficiently typing all keys
-   Large amounts of ngrams
-   Filtering so you can hone in on specific keys and fingers
-   Popular programming language keywords

## Tools

I went on a Javascript adventure. It makes me miss how superior Swift is.

-   [`svelte`](https://svelte.dev/) I like the precompiling, code simplicity, and no runtime bloat.
-   [`skeleton`](https://www.skeleton.dev/) I like where this is going and it is active.
-   [`tailwindcss`](https://tailwindcss.com/) It's an approach and now with css vars too.
-   [`TypeScript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) What a learning curve. 2 steps sideways, one stumble forward.
-   [`typia`](https://github.com/samchon/typia) No more dumb JSON wrangling. Just TypeScript + Typia.
-   [`VS Code`](https://code.visualstudio.com/) Seems decent so far.
-   [`typesafe-i18n`](https://github.com/ivanhofer/typesafe-i18n) Old full stack best practice habbits die hard.

## TODO

-   Other parts of the JamStack Architecture?
-   Host on GitHub Pages!
-   To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
